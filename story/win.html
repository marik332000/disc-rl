<p>
  The immense <b>Input/Output Tower</b> fills the cyberspace above
  you, flashing with information going in and out of the system. As
  you approach the glowing center you grab your <b>identity disc</b>
  in both hands, raising it high over your head. After what feels like
  an eternity, but was actually only a few cycles, your <b>User</b>
  finally responds to your call. Eager to save your existence,
  your <b>User</b> transfers you off the hostile server and back home.
</p>
<p>
  You're now a much more robust and elegant program than when you were
  first lost. Is this what your <b>User</b> had intended for you all
  long?  Everything goes according to the <b>User's</b> plan, so it
  must be.
</p>
<p>
  Congratulations, program! You have escaped <b>Disc RL</b>!
