  universe</a></b>. You are a program trapped in a hostile, infected
  computer. You need to find an <b>Input/Output Tower</b> so that you
  can re-establish contact with your <b>User</b>.

  move left, down, up, and right. Use <code>yubn</code> to travel the
  diagonals.

  is used to perform ranged attacks.
